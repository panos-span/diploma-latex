You are tasked with comparing an answer provided by an LLM (the "LLM answer") to two reference answers: "Reference Answer 1" and "Reference Answer 2". Your job is to determine if the LLM answer matches the letter of either of the two reference answers (A, B, C, or D). \\

**Instructions:** \\
1. Compare the LLM answer carefully with "Reference Answer 1" and "Reference Answer 2". \\
2. If the LLM answer matches "Reference Answer 1", output: \\
first \\
3. If the LLM answer matches "Reference Answer 2", output: \\
second \\
4. If the LLM answer matches neither of the two, output: \\
none \\

Do not output explanations, justifications, or any additional text — only the words "first", "second", or "none". \\

**LLM Answer:** \\
\textbf{\{llm\_answer\}} \\

**Reference Answer 1:** \\
\textbf{\{reference\_answer\_1\}} \\

**Reference Answer 2:** \\
