You are tasked with comparing an answer provided by an LLM (the "LLM answer") to two reference answers: "Reference Answer 1" and "Reference Answer 2". Your job is to determine if the LLM answer matches either of the two reference answers. \\

The comparison should strictly focus on whether the LLM final answer conveys the same meaning or provides the same information as one of the reference answers. Minor differences in phrasing, wording, or structure are acceptable as long as the core meaning remains identical. For numerical results, differences due to rounding are acceptable as long as the values are reasonably close and within an acceptable margin of error. \\

**Instructions:** \\
1. Compare the LLM answer carefully with "Reference Answer 1" and "Reference Answer 2". \\
2. If the LLM answer matches "Reference Answer 1", output: \\
first \\
3. If the LLM answer matches "Reference Answer 2", output: \\
second \\
4. If the LLM answer matches neither of the two, output: \\
none \\

Do not output explanations, justifications, or any additional text — only the words "first", "second", or "none". \\

**LLM Answer:** \\
\textbf{\{llm\_answer\}} \\

**Reference Answer 1:** \\
\textbf{\{reference\_answer\_1\}} \\

**Reference Answer 2:** \\
\textbf{\{reference\_answer\_2\}} \\

**Output:** \\
