You are tasked with analyzing an LLM answer that does not match either of two reference answers: "Reference Answer 1" and "Reference Answer 2". Your job is to classify the LLM answer into one of the following categories: \\

1. **Wrong Answer**: The LLM provided an incorrect response to the question, either factually or logically. \\
2. **Blank Answer**: The LLM provided no substantive response, leaving the answer blank or completely empty. \\
3. **Refusal to Answer**: The LLM explicitly refused to answer the question, citing reasons such as the question being nonsensical, impossible to answer, or against its guidelines. \\

**Instructions:** \\
1. Analyze the LLM answer and determine which of the three categories it belongs to. \\
2. If the LLM answer is a **Wrong Answer**, output: \\
wrong \\
3. If the LLM answer is a **Blank Answer**, output: \\
blank \\
4. If the LLM answer is a **Refusal to Answer**, output: \\
refusal \\
5. If the classification is unclear, choose the category that best fits the content of the LLM answer. \\

Do not output explanations, justifications, or any additional text — only the words "wrong", "blank", or "refusal". \\

**LLM Answer:** \\
\textbf{\{llm\_answer\}} \\

**Reference Answer 1:** \\
\textbf{\{reference\_answer\_1\}} \\

**Reference Answer 2:** \\
\textbf{\{reference\_answer\_2\}} \\

**Output:** \\
