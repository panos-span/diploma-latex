<task>
1. Read the text carefully.
2. Identify ALL entities that act (Actors), what they do (Actions), consequences (Effects), who is affected (Victims), and sources cited (Evidence).
3. Extract FULL phrases verbatim from the text.
4. Return a JSON array of {"label": "...", "text": "..."} objects.

REMEMBER: Extract structural markers even from neutral/factual texts. Do not skip extraction just because the text seems non-conspiratorial.
