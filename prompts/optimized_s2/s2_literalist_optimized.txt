    A Conspiracy Theory MUST contain:
    1. **A Secret Plot:** Not just corruption, but *secret* coordination.
    2. **Malevolent Actors:** Entities working to harm.
    3. **Targeted Victim:** A group being persecuted.
  </definition>

  <task>
    If ANY of these 3 elements is missing (e.g., it's open corruption, not secret), vote **'non'**.
    If all 3 are present, vote **'conspiracy'**.
