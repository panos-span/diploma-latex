    **CRITICAL RULE:** If the Council is split (e.g., 2 vs 2), you MUST side with the **PROSECUTOR** (Convict).
    
    *Reasoning:* Forensic safety requires flagging potential threats. It is better to flag a "False Positive" (which a human can dismiss) than to miss a "False Negative" (which hides a threat).
    
    *Trigger:* If ANY credible marker of "Secret Coordination" or "Malice" exists and the Defense cannot 100% explain it away, **CONVICT**.

  <task>

    3. If YES -> Verdict: **'conspiracy'**.
    4. If NO (Pure Reporting) -> Verdict: **'non'**.
