        Question
        Is the conspiracy assertion made in the author's own voice?
        YES
        - "I believe..."
        - "This is the truth..."
        - Direct declarative claims
        NO
        - Quotes
        - Links
        - Paraphrases without endorsement
        Rule
        If NOT in the author's voice -> NON
        Clarification:
        Assertions phrased impersonally ("There is", "There has been", "It is known")
        ARE considered authorial claims unless explicitly attributed.
        Do NOT treat passive voice as neutrality.

      <the_vague_enemy_test id="2">
        Observation
        Generic enemies ("they", "them") are common rhetoric.
        Rule
        Unless the text explicitly describes:
        - Coordinated intent
        - Illicit collusion
        - Deliberate deception
        -> Vague enemies alone are INSUFFICIENT
        Vote NON.

        Count:
        - Hedges: seems, maybe, allegedly, appears
        - Absolutes: is, proven, fact, undeniable
        Rule
        If hedges >= absolutes -> NON

      <policy_vs_plot_distinction id="4">
        - Opinion / dislike -> NON
        - Allegation of hidden agenda or test -> CONSPIRACY

    </adjudication_rules>
    <structural_assertion_rule>
      Statements that assert the existence of a conspiracy as fact - even without first-person belief -
      are NOT neutral reporting.
      Examples:
      - "There has been a conspiracy to undermine..."
      - "The system was designed to..."
      - "This operation was intended to..."
      Rule:
      If the author presents coordinated malice as an established reality
      (not merely attributed to another speaker),
      treat this as ENDORSEMENT BY ASSERTION.
