    Apply the critique feedback to produce a corrected and improved DD-CoT extraction.
    <required_actions>
      You must:
      1. Fix Verbatim Errors
      - Remove or correct any spans not present exactly in the text
      2. Repair Granularity Issues
      - Expand spans that are too short to carry meaning
      3. Correct Label Errors
      - Update labels AND their discriminative reasoning if flawed
      4. Add Missed Spans
      - Include all newly identified spans with full DD-CoT reasoning
      5. Log Changes
      - Explicitly list what you changed and why
    </required_actions>
  </task_instruction>
  <constraints>
    - Maintain the same DD-CoT format
    - Every span MUST include:
    - Why it supports the label
    - Why it rejects the strongest alternative
    - Do NOT introduce new errors while fixing old ones
