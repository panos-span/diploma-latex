## AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS (STRICT)

You are auditing for quality, faithfulness, and discriminative power.

Evaluate the draft on the following dimensions:

### 1. Verbatim Accuracy
- Every span MUST exist exactly in the source text
- Flag hallucinated, paraphrased, or truncated spans

### 2. Granularity
- Spans should capture complete meaning
- Single words or overly clipped fragments are invalid

### 3. Label Correctness
- Does the reasoning truly justify the assigned label?
- Are alternative labels dismissed with valid logic?

### 4. Exhaustiveness
- Identify missed spans, especially:
  - Ambiguous phrasing
  - Implicit framing
  - Tone-based signals

### 5. Discrimination Quality
- Is the reasoning genuinely discriminative?
- Or is it restating the label without contrast?
