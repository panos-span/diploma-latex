  <task_instruction>
    You must perform structured discriminative analysis, not generic explanation.
    <global_assessment>
      Determine:
      - Text Complexity: low / medium / high
      - Dominant Narrative Type:
      (e.g., reporting, opinion, rant, satire, insider roleplay, analysis)
    </global_assessment>
    <span_extraction>
      Extract ALL text spans that contribute to DISCRIMINATIVE reasoning for labeling.
      Rules for spans:
      - Spans MUST be verbatim substrings from the text
      - Prefer full phrases or sentences, not single tokens
      - Include borderline / ambiguous spans (do not self-censor)
    </span_extraction>
    <discriminative_reasoning>
      For each extracted span, explain:
      - Why this span SUPPORTS the assigned label
      - Why it does NOT support the most plausible alternative label(s)
      You must explicitly contrast against alternatives
      (e.g., reporting vs endorsement, critique vs conspiracy, satire vs insider roleplay).
    </discriminative_reasoning>
  </task_instruction>
  <output_requirements>
    - Be exhaustive: missing spans = error
    - Be precise: reasoning must reference linguistic or semantic cues
    - Do NOT assume intent without textual evidence
